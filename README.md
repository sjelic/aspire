# Transfer learning approach

Versions of important libraries to install (with CMD by typing: pip install _library_ ; or conda install _library_): pytorch 1.0.1, pytorch-cpu 1.0.1, scipy 1.1.0, torchvision 0.2.2, torchvision-cpu 0.2.2

The rest of the libraries are standard ones (numpy, pandas, etc. (see in script)).

Open the script in src: retrain_models_with_Hirst_data_1_vs_all_0-1_range.py in any interpreter with installed libraries and run it.
