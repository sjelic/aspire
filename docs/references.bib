	abstract = {Pollen-induced allergies are among the most prevalent non-contagious diseases, with about a quarter of the European population being sensitive to various atmospheric bioaerosols. In most European countries, pollen information is based on a weekly-cycle Hirst-type pollen trap method. This method is labour-intensive and requires narrow specialized abilities and substantial time, so that the pollen data are always delayed and subject to sampling- and counting-related uncertainties. Emerging new approaches to automatic pollen monitoring can, in principle, allow for realtime availability of the data with no human involvement.},

	abstract = {We present a novel optical aerosol particle detector based on Xe flash lamp excitation and spectrally resolved fluorescence acquisition. We demonstrate its performances on three natural pollens acquiring in real-time scattering intensity at two wavelengths, sub-microsecond time-resolved scattering traces of the particles' passage in the focus, and UV-excited fluorescence spectra. We show that the device gives access to a rather specific detection of the bioaerosol particles.},
